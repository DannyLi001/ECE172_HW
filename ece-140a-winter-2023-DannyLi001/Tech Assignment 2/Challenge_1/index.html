    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Jiajun Li and I am a third year student in University of Clifornia-San Diego.
        My major is Electrical Engineering and Economics. Although I do not have much
        experience in coding, I will try my best. I think coding is pretty fun because it trains 
        our logic and it can present your effort on the screen. By the way, 
        this is my first time making a website, and I hope you like it!
