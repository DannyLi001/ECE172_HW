    <h1>Hello, ECE 140A!</h1>
        <div>
        Hi, everyone. My name is Jiajun Li and come from China. I am 
        major in EE and this is my third year undergraduate. My hobbies are 
        watching videos and playing computer games.

    <h1>First Experience</h1>
        <div>
        My first programming experience is classifying excel files when I was
        doing an intern for three months. The task is quite simple which extract all the information
        needed and write them in a new excel file. I was a beginner of coding 
        that time, so I code badly which write all code in main function without
        any implement of functions.

    <h1>Second Experience</h1>
        <div>
        My second experience is programming ardurino for ECE 5. I took that course in winter when 
        I was a freshman. I think the project such as controlling LEDs, playing with different
        sensors are quite fun. The programming was not that hard and heavy but it provided some
        basic knowledge and guidance. Looking back from present, I think it is a really nice course
        which trigger my interest in Engineering and provide a wide vision. 
        </div>
    <h1>Third Experience</h1>
        <div>
        My third experience is coding for ECE 17. I took ECE 17 in last quarter.
        I did a little coding before that course and it has beed a long time after
        I took ECE 15. I was struggling a lot at the beginning of the course. However, 
        I tried my best and attended every discussion section. I caught up with the PAs
        and finally got an A for that course. I think that I did well because I did not 
        give up.
